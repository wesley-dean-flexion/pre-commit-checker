# Missing or Invalid pre-commit Configuration

The **{{ repository }}** repository doesn't appear to have a valid pre-commit
configuration.  The pre-commit tool provides a scaffolding for running
centrally-managed hooks before commits are formed.

Read more about [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).

## Implications

Typically, these pre-commit hooks are used to verify that stuff that
shouldn't be in commits -- like secrets, credentials, API keys, tokens,
certificates -- aren't allowed in.  If commits can't be created with
secrets in them, then they can't be pushed upstream.

Whether or not an individual developer does or does not run pre-commit
can't be determined without looking at the developer's local files.
It can't be determined if a developer bypasses the protections in
pre-commit.  However, the lack of a pre-commit configuration file in
a repository definitely means developers using ther repository
definitely aren't using pre-commit.

## Installing pre-commit

Installing pre-commit can be performed with `pip` as follows:

```bash
# install the pre-commit tool
pip install pre-commit

# setup the local repo to use pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Each and every repository on a developer's system needs to be configured
to use pre-commit separately.  Having one repository using pre-commit
doesn't have any bearing on any other repository on that system.

## Instructions

Please create a pre-commit configuration file for this repository
and store it as:

`{{ filename }}`

in the root of project.

## Sample pre-commit-config.yaml

This is a sample pre-commit-config.yaml file.  The versions of the
tools have been frozen to specific releases that were current when
this was written.  Updating pre-commit-config.yaml files with
newer versions is a good idea and should be done frequently.  Updating
versions can be done with the pre-commit tool itself:

```bash
# update pre-commit versions
pre-commit autoupdate

# add updated config file
git add .pre-commit-config.yaml && git commit -m "Update pre-commit"

# cleanup old versions
pre-commit gc
```

```YAML

# Run `pre-commit autoupdate` now and then, why don't ya?
